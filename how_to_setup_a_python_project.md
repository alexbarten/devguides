# How to setup a Python project  

## Create your project environment  

1. Create a folder (for instance by using the VSCode terminal (open with 
ctrl ,)  
1. Navigate into the folder from the terminal  
1. Type:  

``` shell
git init <folder name of your project>

Git will create the folder, and it will create a .git folder within the main folder, which will hold the Git configs and history.
